<p>The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest</p>
<p>Today I seriously thought about killing you</p>
<p>I contemplated, premeditated murder</p>
<p>And I think about killing myself, and I love myself way more than I love you, so...</p>
<p>Today I thought about killing you, premeditated murder</p>
<p>You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love</p>
<p>The most beautiful thoughts are always inside the darkest</p>
<p>(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)</p>
<p>Just say it out loud to see how it feels</p>
<p>People say "don't say this, don't say that"</p>
<p>Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels</p>
<p>Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table</p>
<p>Today I thought about killing you, premeditated murder</p>
<p>I think about killing myself, and I, I love myself way more than I love you</p>
<p>The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest</p>
<p>(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)</p>
<p>I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say something good to compensate it so it doesn't come off bad</p>
<p>But sometimes I think really bad things</p>
<p>Really, really, really bad things</p>
<p>And I love myself way more than I love you</p>
<p>See, if I was trying to relate it to more people</p>
<p>I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself because that seems like a common theme</p>
<p>But that's not the case here</p>
<p>I love myself way more than I love you</p>
<p>And I think about killing myself</p>
<p>So, best believe, I thought about killing you today</p>
<p>Premeditated murder</p>

<p>I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins</p>
<p>I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb</p>
<p>Get so bright, it's no sun, get so loud, I hear none</p>
<p>Screamed so loud, got no lungs, hurt so bad, I go numb</p>
<p>Time to bring in the drums, that prrt-pu-pu-pum</p>
<p>Set the NewTone on 'em, set the nuke off on 'em</p>
<p>I need coke with no rum, I taste coke on her tongue</p>
<p>I don't joke with no one, they'll say he die so young</p>
<p>I done had a bad case of too many bad days</p>
<p>Got too many bad traits, used the floor for ashtrays</p>
<p>I don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache</p>
<p>I'ma make my name last, put that on my last name</p>
<p>It's a different type of rules that we obey</p>

vYoung nigga shit, nigga, we don't age</p>

<p>Even when I went broke, I ain't break</p>
<p>How you gon' hate? Nigga, we go way back</p>
<p>To when I had the braids and you had the wave cap</p>
<p>Drop a pimp of the fade and I'm on my way ASAP</p>
<p>Don't get socked in the mouth, you know homie don't play that</p>
<p>Pay the fire marshal bill 'cause this shit done got way packed</p>
<p>They wanna see me go ape (ape, ape)</p>
<p>All you gotta do is speak on Ye</p>
<p>All you gotta do is speak on Ye</p>
